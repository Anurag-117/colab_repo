This folder contains task and work file for the selection task for an intership.

The given Jupyter Notebook list all the task along with comments to help you (and anyone) 
under what underlying task is getting done. Specially with `sgml_parser()` function which might
look complicated but is simple if you go through the comments and `extract_data()` function to see the 
inner working.

The other file `final_report_df.csv` contains the output result.

There are other few files in the root directory; the important one being the `report_links_df.json` 
which stores the downloaded text since the download script (in the same jupyter notebook) might 
takes a long time to scape the data 
(The server discourages scrapping by blocking IP which requests more than 10 requests/min).

There are variety of lambda functions to ease readability while keeping functionality.
