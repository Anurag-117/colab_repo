<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If you’ve dug into any articles on artificial intelligence, you’ve almost certainly run into the term “neural network.” Modeled loosely on the human brain, artificial neural networks enable computers to learn from being fed data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The efficacy of this powerful branch of machine learning, more than anything else, has been responsible for ushering in a new era of artificial intelligence, ending a long-lived “</span><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter"><span style="font-weight:400;">AI Winter</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.” Simply put, the neural network may well be one of the most fundamentally disruptive technologies in existence today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This </span><span style="font-weight:400;">guide to neural networks</span><span style="font-weight:400;">&nbsp;aims to give you a conversational level of understanding of deep learning. To this end, we’ll avoid delving into the math and instead rely as much as possible on analogies and animations.</span></p>
<h2>Thinking by brute force</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">One of the early schools of AI taught that if you load up as much information as possible into a powerful computer and give it as many directions as possible to understand that data, it ought to be able to “think.” This was the idea behind chess computers like IBM’s famous Deep Blue: </span><span style="font-weight:400;">By exhaustively programming every possible chess move into a computer, as well as known strategies, and then giving it sufficient power, IBM programmers created a machine that, in theory, could calculate every possible move and outcome into the future and pick the sequence of subsequent moves to outplay its opponent.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> This actually works, as</span><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)"><span style="font-weight:400;"> chess masters learned in 1997</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">With this sort of computing, the machine relies on fixed rules that have been painstakingly pre-programmed by engineers — if this happens, then that happens; if this happens, do this — and so it isn’t human-style flexible learning as we know it at all. It’s powerful supercomputing, for sure, but not “thinking” per se.</span></p>
<h2>Teaching machines to learn</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Over the past decade, scientists have resurrected an old concept that doesn’t rely on a massive encyclopedic memory bank, but instead on a simple and systematic way of analyzing input data that’s loosely modeled after human thinking. Known as deep learning, or neural networks, this technology has been around since the 1940s, but because of today’s exponential proliferation of data — images, videos, voice searches, browsing habits and more — along with supercharged and affordable processors, it is at last able to begin to fulfill its true potential. </span></p>
<h2>Machines — they’re just like us!</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">An artificial (as opposed to human) neural network (ANN) is an algorithmic construct that enables machines to learn everything from voice commands and playlist curation to music composition and image recognition.The typical ANN consists of thousands of interconnected artificial neurons, which are stacked sequentially in rows that are known as layers, forming millions of connections. In many cases, layers are only interconnected with the layer of neurons before and after them via inputs and outputs. (This is quite different from neurons in a human brain, which are interconnected every which way.)</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This layered ANN is one of the main ways to go about machine learning today, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">and feeding it vast amounts of labeled data enables it to learn how to interpret that data like (and sometimes better than) a human.</span></p>

	</div>
	<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Take, for example, image recognition, which relies on a particular type of neural network known as the convolutional neural network (CNN) — so called because it uses a mathematical process known as convolution to be able to analyze images in non-literal ways, such as identifying a partially obscured object or one that is viewable only from certain angles. (There are other types of neural networks, including recurrent neural networks and feed-forward neural networks, but these are less useful for identifying things like images, which is the example we’re going to use below.)</span></p>
<h2>All aboard the network training</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">So how do neural networks learn? Let’s look at a very simple, yet effective, procedure called supervised learning. Here, we feed the neural network vast amounts of training data, labeled by humans so that a neural network can essentially fact-check itself as it’s learning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Let’s say this labeled data consists of pictures of apples and oranges, respectively. The pictures are the data; “apple” and “orange” are the labels, depending on the picture. As pictures are fed in, the network breaks them down into their most basic components, i.e. edges, textures and shapes. As the picture propagates through the network, these basic components are combined to form more abstract concepts, i.e. curves and different colors which, when combined further, start to look like a stem, an entire orange, or both green and red apples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">At the end of this process, the network attempts to make a prediction as to what’s in the picture. At first, these predictions will appear as random guesses, as no real learning has taken place yet. If the input image is an apple, but “orange” is predicted, the network’s inner layers will need to be adjusted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The adjustments are carried out through a process called backpropagation to increase the likelihood of predicting “apple” for that same image the next time around. This happens over and over until the predictions are more or less accurate and don’t seem to be improving. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Just as when parents teach their kids to identify apples and oranges in real life, for computers too, practice makes perfect.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> If, in your head, you just thought “hey, that sounds like learning,” then you may have a career in AI.</span></p>
<h2>So many layers…</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Typically, a convolutional neural network has four essential layers of neurons besides the input and output layers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Convolution</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Activation</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Pooling</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Fully connected</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Convolution</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In the initial convolution layer or layers, thousands of neurons act as the first set of filters, scouring every part and pixel in the image, looking for patterns. As more and more images are processed, each neuron gradually learns to filter for specific features, which improves accuracy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In the case of apples, one filter might be focused on finding the color red, while another might be looking for rounded edges and yet another might be identifying thin, stick-like stems. If you’ve ever had to clean out a cluttered basement to prepare for a garage sale or a big move — or worked with a professional organizer — then you know what it is to go through everything and sort it into different-themed piles (books, toys, electronics, objets d’art, clothes). That’s sort of what a convolutional layer does with an image by breaking it down into different features.</span></p>
<p>	</p><div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			One advantage of neural networks is that they are capable of learning in a nonlinear way.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">What’s particularly powerful — and one of the neural network’s main claims to fame — is that unlike earlier AI methods (Deep Blue and its ilk), these filters aren’t hand designed; they learn and refine themselves purely by looking at data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The convolution layer essentially creates maps — different, broken-down versions of the picture, each dedicated to a different filtered feature — that indicate where its neurons see an instance (however partial) of the color red, stems, curves and the various other elements of, in this case, an apple. But because the convolution layer is fairly liberal in its identifying of features, it needs an extra set of eyes to make sure nothing of value is missed as a picture moves through the network.</span></p>
<p><strong>Activation</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">One advantage of neural networks is that they are capable of learning in a nonlinear way, which, in mathless terms, means they are able to spot features in images that aren’t quite as obvious — pictures of apples on trees, some of them under direct sunlight and others in the shade, or piled into a bowl on a kitchen counter. This is all thanks to the activation layer, which serves to more or less highlight the valuable stuff — both the straightforward and harder-to-spot varieties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In the world of our garage-sale organizer or clutter consultant, imagine that from each of those separated piles of things we’ve cherry-picked a few items — a handful of rare books, some classic t-shirts from our college days to wear ironically — that we might want to keep. We stick these “maybe” items on top of their respective category piles for another consideration later.</span></p>
<p><strong>Pooling</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">All this “convolving” across an entire image generates a lot of information, and this can quickly become a computational nightmare. Enter the pooling layer, which shrinks it all into a more general and digestible form. There are many ways to go about this, but one of the most popular is “max pooling,” which edits down each feature map into a </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Reader’s Digest</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> version of itself, so that only the best examples of redness, stem-ness or curviness are featured. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In the garage spring cleaning example, if we were using famed Japanese clutter consultant Marie Kondo’s principles, our pack rat would have to choose only the things that “spark joy” from the smaller assortment of favorites in each category pile, and sell or toss everything else. So now we still have all our piles categorized by type of item, but only consisting of the items we actually want to keep; everything else gets sold. (And this, by the way, ends our de-cluttering analogy to help describe the filtering and downsizing that goes on inside a neural network.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">At this point, a neural network designer can stack subsequent layered configurations of this sort — convolution, activation, pooling — and continue to filter down images to get higher-level information. In the case of identifying an apple in pictures, the images get filtered down over and over, with initial layers showing just barely discernable parts of an edge, a blip of red or just the tip of a stem, while subsequent, more filtered layers will show entire apples. Either way, when it’s time to start getting results, the fully connected layer comes into play.</span></p>
<p></p><div id="attachment_1476746" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1476746" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1476746 size-full" src="./Neural networks made easy – TechCrunch_files/neural_networks_convolution_layers_gumgum1.gif" alt="" width="1600" height="588"><p id="caption-attachment-1476746" class="wp-caption-text">Source: GumGum</p></div><p></p>
<p><b>Fully connected</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Now it’s time to start getting answers. In the fully connected layer, each reduced, or “pooled,” feature map is “fully connected” to output nodes (neurons) that represent the items the neural network is learning to identify. If the network is tasked with learning how to spot cats, dogs, guinea pigs and gerbils, then it’ll have four output nodes. In the case of the neural network we’ve been describing, it’ll just have two output nodes: one for “apples” and one for “oranges.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If the picture that has been fed through the network is of an apple, and the network has already undergone some training and is getting better with its predictions, then it’s likely that a good chunk of the feature maps contain quality instances of apple features. This is where these final output nodes start to fulfill their destiny, with a reverse election of sorts.</span></p>
<p>	</p><div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Tweaks and adjustments are made to help each neuron better identify the data at every level.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The job (which they’ve learned “on the job”) of both the apple and orange nodes is essentially to “vote” for the feature maps that contain their respective fruits. So, the more the “apple” node thinks a particular feature map contains “apple” features, the more votes it sends to that feature map. Both nodes have to vote on every single feature map, regardless of what it contains. So in this case, the “orange” node won’t send many votes to any of the feature maps, because they don’t really contain any “orange” features. In the end, the node that has sent the most votes out — in this example, the “apple” node — can be considered the network’s “answer,” though it’s not quite that simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Because the same network is looking for two different things — apples and oranges — the final output of the network is expressed as percentages. In this case, we’re assuming that the network is already a bit down the road in its training, so the predictions here might be, say, 75 percent “apple” and 25 percent “orange.” Or, if it’s earlier in the training, it might be more inaccurate and determine that it’s 20 percent “apple” and 80 percent “orange.” Oops.</span></p>
<p></p><div id="attachment_1476747" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1476747" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1476747 size-full" src="./Neural networks made easy – TechCrunch_files/neural_networks_fully_connected_layers_gumgum1.gif" alt="" width="1600" height="588"><p id="caption-attachment-1476747" class="wp-caption-text">Source: GumGum</p></div><p></p>
<h2>If at first you don’t succeed, try, try, try again</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">So, in its early stages, the neural network spits out a bunch of wrong answers in the form of percentages. The 20 percent “apple” and 80 percent “orange” prediction is clearly wrong, but since this is supervised learning with labeled training data, the network is able to figure out where and how that error occurred through a system of checks and balances known as backpropagation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;"> Now, this is a mathless explanation, so suffice it to say that backpropagation sends feedback to the previous layer’s nodes about just how far off the answers were. That layer then sends the feedback to the previous layer, and on and on like a game of telephone until it’s back at convolution. Tweaks and adjustments are made to help each neuron better identify the data at every level when subsequent images go through the network. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This process is repeated over and over until the neural network is identifying apples and oranges in images with increasing accuracy, eventually ending up at 100 percent correct predictions — though many engineers consider 85 percent to be acceptable. And when that happens, the neural network is ready for prime time and can start identifying apples in pictures professionally.</span></p>

But on this record \u2014 while the government has established that China\u2019s activities raise significant national- security concerns \u2014 it has put in scant little evidence that its effective ban of WeChat for all U.S. users addresses those concerns. And, as the plaintiffs point out, there are obvious alternatives to a complete ban, such as barring WeChat from government devices, as Australia has done, or taking other steps to address data security.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Given the likelihood of a lawsuit proceeding and the immediate damage a ban would have if implemented, the judge initiated a nationwide injunction against implementation of the Commerce Department\u2019s order to ban the app.<\/p>\n<p>Commerce will have a chance to respond to this development, and whether it chooses to edit its order, pursue other avenues through the courts, or just rescind the order entirely, we will see in the coming days.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A few days ago, the U.S. Commerce Department published a series of rules that aimed to block the downloading of TikTok and WeChat by American users, following an executive order signed by President Trump back in August.

Users collected these cricket-themed stickers for sending money to others, or making transactions such as topping up credit on their phone or paying their broadband or electricity bill.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement on Sunday evening, a Google spokesperson said, \u201coffering cashbacks and vouchers alone do not constitute a violation of our Google Play gambling policies\u201d and that Play Store \u201cpolicies are applied and enforced on all developers consistently.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s arguably anything but consistent.<\/p>\n<p>On September 18, Google told Paytm that it had pulled its app for not complying with Play Store\u2019s \u201cgambling policy\u201d as it offered games with \u201cloyalty points.\u201d Paytm said that Google had not expressed any concerns over Paytm\u2019s new marketing campaign prior to its notice on Friday, in which it revealed that Paytm app had been temporarily removed from the Play Store.<\/p>\n<p>But Google itself is running a similar campaign linked to cricket in India, Paytm argues. (Why cricket? Cricket is immensely popular in India and one of the biggest cricket tournaments globally, Indian Premier League, kicked off its latest season on Saturday.)<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2049284\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2049284 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg 3284w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=150,42 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=300,84 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=768,214 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=680,190 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=1536,428 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=2048,571 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/paytm-google-pay-india.jpg?resize=50,14 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2049284\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cricket-themed cashback offered by Paytm (left) and Google Pay (right) in India<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Google Play Store in India has long prohibited apps that promote gambling such as betting on sporting events, and Google has raised concerns about Paytm&#8217;s marquee app promoting Paytm First Games, a fantasy sports app run by Paytm, in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm executives argued that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/phonepe\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"phonepe\">PhonePe, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a Walmart-owned payments app in India, also promoted Dream11, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/14\/indian-fantasy-sports-app-dream11s-parent-firm-raises-225m-at-over-2-5b-valuation\/\">most popular fantasy sports app in the country<\/a>, and got away without any action.<\/p>\n<p>Google also permits fantasy sports app operators &#8212; including Paytm &#8212; to advertise on Search in India.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-theme=\"light\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Where is Google hypocritical?

The removal of Paytm app was only on the grounds of Paytm offering cricket-themed cashback, he claimed. \u201cGoogle is not allowing us to acquire new customers right now. That\u2019s all what this is,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s payments app, Google Pay, competes with Paytm in India. In fact, Google Pay is the largest payments app for peer-to-peer transaction between users in India and holds the largest market share in UPI.<\/p>\n<p>Without identifying any names, Sharma, the poster child of Indian startup ecosystem, claimed that many founders in India have just accepted that it is Google that has the final say on any matter in India &#8212; and not the country\u2019s regulatory agencies.<\/p>\n<p>For Google, which reaches more users than any other company in India and whose Android operating system commands 99% of the local smartphone market, this kind of accusation is exactly what it needs to avoid in the country. The Silicon Valley search and advertising giant has launched a charm offensive in India, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/13\/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india\/\">recently commitment to invest $10 billion<\/a> &#8212;\u00a0more than any other American or Chinese technology firm.<\/p>\n<p>The timing for Google&#8217;s parent company, Alphabet, couldn&#8217;t be worse. Google is currently the <a href=\"https:\/\/in.reuters.com\/article\/us-india-google-antitrust-exclusive\/exclusive-google-faces-antitrust-case-in-india-over-payments-app-sources-idUKKBN2331G3\">subject of an antitrust complaint<\/a> in India over an allegation that it has abused its market position to unfairly promote its mobile payments app in the country; and in the U.S., Congress has intimidated that it may pursue antitrust regulatory action against Alphabet and Apple over app store concerns.<\/p>\n<p>In India, Google&#8217;s moves could have a devastating impact on businesses and everyday consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Paytm is not just a payments app. It is also a fully licensed digital bank. And just an eight-hour of absence from the Play Store created a panic among a portion of its users. A source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that Paytm saw several people withdraw their fixed deposit in Paytm Payments Bank on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Anecdotally, TechCrunch heard of instances where vendors who previously preferred Paytm for accepting money digitally asked their customers to use a different payments method as they had heard that Paytm was \u201cbanned\u201d in India.<\/p>\n<p>Sharma said Google&#8217;s monopoly on Indian app ecosystem is of a magnitude unparalleled elsewhere in the world.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf paying someone and getting a cashback is gambling, then the same rule should be applied to everyone,\u201d said Sharma. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that we are standing here at the cusp of an internet revolution in India and we are being sanctioned by companies that are not governed by the law of this country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If this sentiment gained traction in India it could create challenges for Google&#8217;s future in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. is forcing a Chinese company to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/19\/tiktok-deal-terms\/\">sell stakes to local firms to continue operations in the country<\/a>. In a recent episode of Dithering podcast, Ben Thompson cautioned that Trump administration\u2019s move &#8212; which some have argued is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/08\/18\/opinion\/tiktok-wechat-ban-trump.html\">a long due tit for tat against Chinese companies<\/a> (as China has long prevented U.S. firms from meaningfully operating in the world&#8217;s largest \u00a0internet market) &#8212;\u00a0might encourage\u00a0other open markets to do to American firms what it is doing to TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>Several U.S. tech executives share these concerns.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The problem with this TikTok deal is that the US is the largest player in tech globally.

capitalism and the American theft of Chinese innovation"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">It used to be \u201ceasy\u201d to tell the American and Chinese economies apart. One was innovative, one made clones. One was a free market while the other demanded payments to a political party and its leadership, a corrupt wealth generating scam that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/global\/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html\">by some estimates<\/a> has netted top leaders billions of dollars. One kept the talent borders porous acting as a magnet for the world\u2019s top brains while the other interviewed you in a backroom at the airport before imprisoning you on sedition charges (okay, that might have been both).<\/p>\n<p>The comparison was always facile yes, but it was easy and at least directionally accurate if failing on the specifics.<\/p>\n<p>Now though, the country that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2019\/04\/lithium-ion-batteries-amazon-are-exploding\/587005\/\">exported exploding batteries<\/a> is pioneering quantum computing, while the country that pioneered the internet <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/03\/made-in-america-is-on-government-life-support-and-the-prognosis-isnt-good\/\">now builds planes that fall out of the sky<\/a> (and good news, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/boeing-flags-additional-787-production-problem-11599577936\">we\u2019ve identified even more planes<\/a> that might fall out of the sky at an airport near you!)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> success is many things, but it is quite frankly just an embarrassment for the United States. There are thousands of entrepreneurs and hundreds of venture capitalists swarming Silicon Valley and the other American innovation hubs looking for the next great social app or building it themselves. But the power law of user growth and investor returns happens to reside in Haidian, Beijing. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bytedance\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bytedance\">ByteDance <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> through its local apps in China and overseas apps like TikTok <i>is<\/i> the consumer investor return of the past decade (there\u2019s a reason why all the IPOs this seasons are enterprise SaaS).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a win that you can\u2019t chalk up just to industrial policy. Unlike in semiconductors or other capital-intensive industries where Beijing can offer billions in incentives to spur development, ByteDance builds apps. It distributes them on app stores across the world. It has exactly the same tools available to it that every entrepreneur with an Apple Developer account has access to. There is no <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csis.org\/analysis\/made-china-2025\">Made in China 2025<\/a> plan to build and popularize a consumer app like TikTok (you literally can\u2019t plan for consumer success like that). Instead, it\u2019s a well-executed product that\u2019s addictive to hundreds of millions of people.<\/p>\n<p>So much as China protected its industry from overseas competitors like Google and Amazon through market-entry barriers, America is now protecting its entrenched incumbents from overseas competitors like TikTok. We\u2019re demanding joint ventures and local cloud data sovereignty just as the Communist Party has demanded for years.<\/p>\n<p>Hell, we\u2019re apparently demanding a $5 billion tax payment from ByteDance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-09-20\/trump-wants-5-billion-from-tiktok-deal-for-new-history-project\">which the president says will fund patriotic education for youth<\/a>. The president says a lot of things of course, but at least the $5 billion price point has been confirmed by Oracle in its press release over night (what the tax revenue will <i>actually<\/i> be used for is anyone\u2019s guess). If you followed the recent Hong Kong protests for a long time, you will remember that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-hongkong-patriotism\/hong-kong-frets-over-china-model-patriotic-education-idUSBRE86A09L20120711\">patriotic youth education<\/a> was some of the original tinder for those demonstrations back in 2012. What comes around, goes around, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>Development economists like to talk about \u201ccatch-up\u201d strategies, tactics that countries can take to avoid the middle income trap and cut the gap between the West and the rest. But what we need now are developed economists to explain America\u2019s \u201cfall behind\u201d strategy. Because we are falling behind, in pretty much everything.<\/p>\n<p>As the TikTok process and the earlier Huawei imbroglio show, America is no longer on the leading edge of technology in many key strategic markets. Mainland Chinese companies are globally winning in areas as diverse as 5G and social networks, and without direct government intervention to kill that innovation, American and European tech purveyors would have lost those markets entirely (and even <i>with<\/i> those interventions, they may still lose them). In Taiwan, TSMC has come from behind Intel to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/051b2c80-d53b-410e-8e80-f433d25a82dd\">take a year or two lead<\/a> in the fabrication of the most advanced semiconductors.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, we can\u2019t even pilfer Chinese history and mythology and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21428088\/mulan-review-disney-live-action-remake\">turn it into a decent god damn film<\/a> these days.<\/p>\n<p>And the fall-behind strategy continues. Immigration restrictions from an administration hell-bent on destroying the single greatest source of American innovation, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, have fused into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/international-student-enrollment-trump-covid19-5caad69c-f6d4-4b79-bfb4-7b6ed038bc5b.html\">the largest single drop in international student migration in American history<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Why does that matter? In the U.S. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/quicktakes\/2017\/10\/11\/foreign-students-and-graduate-stem-enrollment\">according to relatively recent data<\/a>, 81% of electrical engineering grad students are international, 79% in computer science are, and in most engineering and technical fields, the number hovers above a majority.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s great to believe the fantasy that if only these international grad students would stay home, then \u201creal\u201d Americans would somehow take these slots. But what\u2019s true of the strawberry pickers and food service workers is also true for EE grad students: proverbial \u201cAmericans\u201d don\u2019t want these jobs. They are hard jobs, thankless jobs, and require a ridiculous tenacity that American workers and students by and large don\u2019t have. These industries have huge contingents of foreign workers precisely because no one domestic wants to take these roles.<\/p>\n<p>So goes the talent, so goes the innovation. Without this wellspring of brainpower lodging itself in America\u2019s top innovation hubs, where exactly do we think it will go? That former aspiring Stanford or MIT computer scientist with ideas in his or her brain isn\u2019t just going to sit by the window gazing at the horizon waiting for the moment when they can enter the gilded halls of the U.S. of A. It\u2019s the internet era, and they are just going to get started on their dreams wherever they are, using whatever tools and resources they have available to them.<\/p>\n<p>All you have to do is look at the recent YC batches and realize that the future cohorts of great startups are going to increasingly come from outside the continental 48. Dozens of smart, brilliant entrepreneurs aren\u2019t even trying to migrate, instead rightfully seeing their home markets as more open to innovation and technological progress than the vaunted superpower. The frontier is closed here, and it has moved elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>So what are we left with here in the U.S. and increasingly Europe? A narrow-minded policy of blocking external tech innovation to ensure that our sclerotic and entrenched incumbents don\u2019t have to compete with the best in the world. If that isn\u2019t a recipe for economic disaster, I don\u2019t know what is.<\/p>\n<p>But hey: at least the youth will be patriotic.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It used to be \u201ceasy\u201d to tell the American and Chinese economies apart.

subscription monetization to more apps in 2016 \u2014 and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/6\/8\/11880730\/apple-app-store-subscription-update-phil-schiller-interview\">enticed developers with an 85\/15 split<\/a> on revenue from customers that remain subscribed for more than a year \u2014 subscription monetization and retention has felt like the Holy Grail for app developers. So much so that <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/112622?hl=en\">Google quickly followed suit<\/a>\u00a0in what appeared to be an example of healthy competition for developers in the mobile OS duopoly.<\/p>\n<p>But how does that split actually work out for most apps? Turns out, the 85\/15 split \u2014 which Apple is keen to mention anytime developers complain about the App Store rev share \u2014 doesn\u2019t have a meaningful impact for most developers. Because churn.<\/p>\n<p>No matter how great an app is, subscribers are going to churn. Sometimes it\u2019s because of a credit card expiring or some other billing issue. And sometimes it\u2019s more of a pause, and the user comes back after a few months. But the majority of churn comes from subscribers who, for whatever reason, decide that the app just isn\u2019t worth paying for anymore. If a subscriber churns before the one-year mark, the developer never sees that 85% split. And even if the user resubscribes, Apple and Google reset the clock if a subscription has lapsed for more than 60 days. Rather convenient\u2026 for Apple and Google.<\/p>\n<p>Top mobile apps like Netflix and Spotify report churn rates in the low single digits, but they are the outliers. According to our data, the median churn rate for subscription apps is around\u00a013% for monthly subscriptions\u00a0and around 50% for annual. Monthly subscription churn is generally a bit higher in the first few months, then it tapers off. But an average churn of 13% leaves just 20% of subscribers crossing that magical 85\/15 threshold.<\/p>\n<p>In practice, what this means is that, for all the hype around the 85\/15 split, very few developers are going to see a meaningful increase in revenue:<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2048964\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

To this end, we\u2019ll avoid delving into the math and instead rely as much as possible on analogies and animations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Thinking by brute force<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">One of the early schools of AI taught that if you load up as much information as possible into a powerful computer and give it as many directions as possible to understand that data, it ought to be able to \u201cthink.\u201d This was the idea behind chess computers like IBM\u2019s famous Deep Blue: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">By exhaustively programming every possible chess move into a computer, as well as known strategies, and then giving it sufficient power, IBM programmers created a machine that, in theory, could calculate every possible move and outcome into the future and pick the sequence of subsequent moves to outplay its opponent.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> This actually works, as<\/span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> chess masters learned in 1997<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">.*<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">With this sort of computing, the machine relies on fixed rules that have been painstakingly pre-programmed by engineers \u2014 if this happens, then that happens; if this happens, do this \u2014 and so it isn\u2019t human-style flexible learning as we know it at all. It\u2019s powerful supercomputing, for sure, but not \u201cthinking\u201d per se.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Teaching machines to learn<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Over the past decade, scientists have resurrected an old concept that doesn\u2019t rely on a massive encyclopedic memory bank, but instead on a simple and systematic way of analyzing input data that\u2019s loosely modeled after human thinking. Known as deep learning, or neural networks, this technology has been around since the 1940s, but because of today\u2019s exponential proliferation of data \u2014 images, videos, voice searches, browsing habits and more \u2014 along with supercharged and affordable processors, it is at last able to begin to fulfill its true potential. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Machines &#8212; they\u2019re just like us!<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">An artificial (as opposed to human) neural network (ANN) is an algorithmic construct that enables machines to learn everything from voice commands and playlist curation to music composition and image recognition.The typical ANN consists of thousands of interconnected artificial neurons, which are stacked sequentially in rows that are known as layers, forming millions of connections. In many cases, layers are only interconnected with the layer of neurons before and after them via inputs and outputs. (This is quite different from neurons in a human brain, which are interconnected every which way.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1476748\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1476748\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-1476748 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/neural_networks_machines_like_us_gumgum1.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"588\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1476748\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: GumGum<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">This layered ANN is one of the main ways to go about machine learning today, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">and feeding it vast amounts of labeled data enables it to learn how to interpret that data like (and sometimes better than) a human.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tJust as when parents teach their kids to identify apples and oranges in real life, for computers too, practice makes perfect.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Take, for example, image recognition, which relies on a particular type of neural network known as the convolutional neural network (CNN) \u2014 so called because it uses a mathematical process known as convolution to be able to analyze images in non-literal ways, such as identifying a partially obscured object or one that is viewable only from certain angles. (There are other types of neural networks, including recurrent neural networks and feed-forward neural networks, but these are less useful for identifying things like images, which is the example we\u2019re going to use below.)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>All aboard the network training<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">So how do neural networks learn? Let\u2019s look at a very simple, yet effective, procedure called supervised learning. Here, we feed the neural network vast amounts of training data, labeled by humans so that a neural network can essentially fact-check itself as it\u2019s learning. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Let\u2019s say this labeled data consists of pictures of apples and oranges, respectively. The pictures are the data; &#8220;apple&#8221; and &#8220;orange&#8221; are the labels, depending on the picture. As pictures are fed in, the network breaks them down into their most basic components, i.e. edges, textures and shapes. As the picture propagates through the network, these basic components are combined to form more abstract concepts, i.e. curves and different colors which, when combined further, start to look like a stem, an entire orange, or both green and red apples.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">At the end of this process, the network attempts to make a prediction as to what\u2019s in the picture. At first, these predictions will appear as random guesses, as no real learning has taken place yet. If the input image is an apple, but &#8220;orange&#8221; is predicted, the network\u2019s inner layers will need to be adjusted. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The adjustments are carried out through a process called backpropagation to increase the likelihood of predicting &#8220;apple&#8221; for that same image the next time around. This happens over and over until the predictions are more or less accurate and don\u2019t seem to be improving. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Just as when parents teach their kids to identify apples and oranges in real life, for computers too, practice makes perfect.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> If, in your head, you just thought \u201chey, that sounds like learning,\u201d then you may have a career in AI.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>So many layers\u2026<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Typically, a convolutional neural network has four essential layers of neurons besides the input and output layers:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Convolution<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Activation<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Pooling<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Fully connected<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Convolution<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In the initial convolution layer or layers, thousands of neurons act as the first set of filters, scouring every part and pixel in the image, looking for patterns. As more and more images are processed, each neuron gradually learns to filter for specific features, which improves accuracy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In the case of apples, one filter might be focused on finding the color red, while another might be looking for rounded edges and yet another might be identifying thin, stick-like stems. If you\u2019ve ever had to clean out a cluttered basement to prepare for a garage sale or a big move \u2014 or worked with a professional organizer \u2014 then you know what it is to go through everything and sort it into different-themed piles (books, toys, electronics, objets d\u2019art, clothes). That\u2019s sort of what a convolutional layer does with an image by breaking it down into different features.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tOne advantage of neural networks is that they are capable of learning in a nonlinear way.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">What\u2019s particularly powerful \u2014 and one of the neural network\u2019s main claims to fame \u2014 is that unlike earlier AI methods (Deep Blue and its ilk), these filters aren\u2019t hand designed; they learn and refine themselves purely by looking at data.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The convolution layer essentially creates maps \u2014 different, broken-down versions of the picture, each dedicated to a different filtered feature \u2014 that indicate where its neurons see an instance (however partial) of the color red, stems, curves and the various other elements of, in this case, an apple. But because the convolution layer is fairly liberal in its identifying of features, it needs an extra set of eyes to make sure nothing of value is missed as a picture moves through the network.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Activation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">One advantage of neural networks is that they are capable of learning in a nonlinear way, which, in mathless terms, means they are able to spot features in images that aren\u2019t quite as obvious \u2014 pictures of apples on trees, some of them under direct sunlight and others in the shade, or piled into a bowl on a kitchen counter. This is all thanks to the activation layer, which serves to more or less highlight the valuable stuff \u2014 both the straightforward and harder-to-spot varieties. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In the world of our garage-sale organizer or clutter consultant, imagine that from each of those separated piles of things we\u2019ve cherry-picked a few items \u2014 a handful of rare books, some classic t-shirts from our college days to wear ironically \u2014 that we might want to keep. We stick these \u201cmaybe\u201d items on top of their respective category piles for another consideration later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Pooling<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">All this \u201cconvolving\u201d across an entire image generates a lot of information, and this can quickly become a computational nightmare. Enter the pooling layer, which shrinks it all into a more general and digestible form. There are many ways to go about this, but one of the most popular is \u201cmax pooling,\u201d which edits down each feature map into a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Reader\u2019s Digest<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> version of itself, so that only the best examples of redness, stem-ness or curviness are featured. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In the garage spring cleaning example, if we were using famed Japanese clutter consultant Marie Kondo\u2019s principles, our pack rat would have to choose only the things that \u201cspark joy\u201d from the smaller assortment of favorites in each category pile, and sell or toss everything else. So now we still have all our piles categorized by type of item, but only consisting of the items we actually want to keep; everything else gets sold. (And this, by the way, ends our de-cluttering analogy to help describe the filtering and downsizing that goes on inside a neural network.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">At this point, a neural network designer can stack subsequent layered configurations of this sort \u2014 convolution, activation, pooling \u2014 and continue to filter down images to get higher-level information. In the case of identifying an apple in pictures, the images get filtered down over and over, with initial layers showing just barely discernable parts of an edge, a blip of red or just the tip of a stem, while subsequent, more filtered layers will show entire apples. Either way, when it\u2019s time to start getting results, the fully connected layer comes into play.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1476746\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1476746\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-1476746 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/neural_networks_convolution_layers_gumgum1.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"588\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1476746\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: GumGum<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><b>Fully connected<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Now it\u2019s time to start getting answers. In the fully connected layer, each reduced, or \u201cpooled,\u201d feature map is \u201cfully connected\u201d to output nodes (neurons) that represent the items the neural network is learning to identify. If the network is tasked with learning how to spot cats, dogs, guinea pigs and gerbils, then it\u2019ll have four output nodes. In the case of the neural network we\u2019ve been describing, it\u2019ll just have two output nodes: one for \u201capples\u201d and one for \u201coranges.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">If the picture that has been fed through the network is of an apple, and the network has already undergone some training and is getting better with its predictions, then it\u2019s likely that a good chunk of the feature maps contain quality instances of apple features. This is where these final output nodes start to fulfill their destiny, with a reverse election of sorts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tTweaks and adjustments are made to help each neuron better identify the data at every level.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The job (which they\u2019ve learned \u201con the job\u201d) of both the apple and orange nodes is essentially to \u201cvote\u201d for the feature maps that contain their respective fruits. So, the more the &#8220;apple&#8221; node thinks a particular feature map contains &#8220;apple&#8221; features, the more votes it sends to that feature map. Both nodes have to vote on every single feature map, regardless of what it contains. So in this case, the &#8220;orange&#8221; node won\u2019t send many votes to any of the feature maps, because they don\u2019t really contain any &#8220;orange&#8221; features. In the end, the node that has sent the most votes out \u2014 in this example, the &#8220;apple&#8221; node \u2014 can be considered the network\u2019s \u201canswer,\u201d though it\u2019s not quite that simple.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Because the same network is looking for two different things \u2014 apples and oranges \u2014 the final output of the network is expressed as percentages. In this case, we\u2019re assuming that the network is already a bit down the road in its training, so the predictions here might be, say, 75 percent \u201capple\u201d and 25 percent \u201corange.\u201d Or, if it\u2019s earlier in the training, it might be more inaccurate and determine that it\u2019s 20 percent \u201capple\u201d and 80 percent \u201corange.\u201d Oops.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1476747\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1476747\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-1476747 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/neural_networks_fully_connected_layers_gumgum1.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"588\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1476747\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: GumGum<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<h2>If at first you don\u2019t succeed, try, try, try again<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">So, in its early stages, the neural network spits out a bunch of wrong answers in the form of percentages. The 20 percent \u201capple\u201d and 80 percent \u201corange\u201d prediction is clearly wrong, but since this is supervised learning with labeled training data, the network is able to figure out where and how that error occurred through a system of checks and balances known as backpropagation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> Now, this is a mathless explanation, so suffice it to say that backpropagation sends feedback to the previous layer\u2019s nodes about just how far off the answers were.
